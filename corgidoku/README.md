# Corgidoku

Cheddar's puzzle yard for Halina. A corgi take on Queens-style logic puzzles: one corgi per row, column and colored yard, and no two corgis touch, not even diagonally. See `SPEC.md` for the exact rules, technique ladder and file format.

**Play:** https://brothernod.github.io/PhoneApps/corgidoku/. On iPhone, open it in Safari and tap Share → Add to Home Screen so the streak is never wiped.

## What's here

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `app.js`, `art.js` | The game: daily puzzle, The Climb (60 levels), past days, hints, stats |
| `engine.js` | Generator, exact solver, human-technique grader (shared by game and tools) |
| `puzzles.json` | 730 daily puzzles from 2026-11-05 + 60 Climb levels, all verified |
| `tools/generate.mjs` | Builds `puzzles.json`; also hunts big boards on a strong PC |
| `tools/verify.mjs` | Independent checker, written separately from the generator |
| `tools/pool-9.json` | 9×9 boards used on every other Sunday |

## Regenerate or extend puzzles

Needs Node 18+ (Windows: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`). From this folder:

```
node tools/generate.mjs --start 2026-11-05 --pool tools/pool-9.json
node tools/verify.mjs
```

The output is deterministic for a given `--seed`. Always run `verify.mjs` before committing.

## Heavy pass on the desktop PC

Big boards are fast (thousands per minute), so the PC's real job is hunting the rare **hard** boards (about 1 in 100). Use every core and let it run; it saves every 10 boards and resumes where it left off:

```
node tools/generate.mjs --pool-sizes 9,10 --pool-grade hard --pool-count 100 --pool-out tools/pool-hard.json --workers 16
```

Then rebuild with that pool (`--pool tools/pool-hard.json`), verify, and commit.

## Special dates

The 2026-11-11 week gets easy puzzles and a get-well banner. Every June 15 gets a birthday banner, an easy puzzle and a party hat for Cheddar. Messages live in `specialBanner()` and `winLine()` in `app.js`; the schedule lives in `want()` in `tools/generate.mjs`.
