# Corgidoku

Cheddar's puzzle yard for Halina. A corgi take on Queens-style logic puzzles: one corgi per row, column and colored yard, and no two corgis touch, not even diagonally. See `SPEC.md` for the exact rules, technique ladder and file format.

**Play:** https://brothernod.github.io/PhoneApps/corgidoku/. On iPhone, open it in Safari and tap Share → Add to Home Screen so the streak is never wiped.

## What's here

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `app.js`, `art.js` | The game: daily puzzle, The Climb (60 levels), past days, hints, stats |
| `puzzles-extreme.json` | Extreme mode (grown-ups only): 730 daily 9×9/10×10 boards from 2026-11-05 that need "what if" chains + 120-level Extreme Climb |
| `engine.js` | Generator, exact solver, human-technique grader (shared by game and tools) |
| `puzzles.json` | Cozy mode: 730 daily puzzles from 2026-11-05 + 60 Climb levels, all verified |
| `puzzles-hard.json` | Hard mode: 730 daily 8×8–10×10 boards needing pair/group locks + 80-level Hard Climb |
| `puzzles-kids.json` | Chill mode (kids only): 760 daily 5×5/6×6 boards from 2026-10-01 + 40-level Chill Climb (4×4 up to 7×7) |
| `tools/generate.mjs` | Builds `puzzles.json`; also hunts big boards on a strong PC |
| `tools/verify.mjs` | Independent checker, written separately from the generator |
| `tools/pool-9.json` | 9×9 boards used on every other Sunday |

## Regenerate or extend puzzles

Needs Node 18+ (Windows: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`). From this folder:

```
node tools/generate.mjs --start 2026-11-05 --pool tools/pool-9.json
node tools/generate.mjs --mode hard --start 2026-11-05
node tools/generate.mjs --mode extreme --start 2026-11-05 --seed 6
node tools/generate.mjs --mode kids --start 2026-10-01 --days 760
node tools/verify.mjs
node tools/verify.mjs puzzles-hard.json
node tools/verify.mjs puzzles-extreme.json
node tools/verify.mjs puzzles-kids.json
```

The output is deterministic for a given `--seed`. Always run `verify.mjs` before committing.

## Heavy pass on the desktop PC

Big boards are fast (thousands per minute), so the PC's real job is hunting the rare **hard** boards (about 1 in 100). Use every core and let it run; it saves every 10 boards and resumes where it left off:

```
node tools/generate.mjs --pool-sizes 9,10 --pool-grade hard --pool-count 100 --pool-out tools/pool-hard.json --workers 16
```

Then rebuild with that pool (`--pool tools/pool-hard.json`), verify, and commit.

## Extreme mode

Built from Halina's Hard field report (86 boards, all rated 2–5 out of 10, median about 4 minutes). Bigger step counts and long stretches with no new corgi nudged her ratings up a little, but nothing inside the L1–L5 ladder got past a 5. So Extreme adds a sixth technique, the "what if" chain (see `SPEC.md`), and sorts boards by chain score = chains + 3 × (longest chain − 1):

| Tier | What it needs | Where it shows up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X0 | L5 with 25+ steps (the top of Hard) | Climb holds 1–20 |
| X1 | 1–2 short what-ifs (score ≤ 2) | Holds 21–45, Mon/Tue dailies |
| X2 | Score 3–5 | Holds 46–75, Wed/Thu |
| X3 | Score 6–11 | Holds 76–100, Fri/Sat, some Sundays |
| X4 | Score 12+ | Holds 101–120 (the summit), some Sundays |

Only 9×9 and 10×10. Boards already in `puzzles-hard.json` are never reused. The daily file starts 2026-11-05, the day Halina started playing, so Past days reaches back to her first day. The kids don't see Extreme. The first time someone opens Extreme, a short sheet explains what-ifs. Field reports now end with `chains,depth`, so Extreme ratings can be matched against the chain score.

## Players

Settings → Who's playing? switches between Default, Holden and Quentin. Each player has their own progress, streak, Climb and settings in localStorage (`corgidoku:v1` for Default, so existing progress is untouched; `corgidoku:v1:holden` and `corgidoku:v1:quentin` for the kids). The active player is in `corgidoku:player`.

Kid players see their name next to Cheddar on the home screen, get the 🐣 Chill mode (alongside Cozy and Hard), and start with Relaxed on, the timer off and Easy double-tap on (560 ms window instead of 380 ms, plus a little finger wiggle allowed). Halina's special-date banners don't show for the kids.

The Chill Climb: holds 1–6 are 4×4 "last spot" only, 7–28 stay on 5×5/6×6 with only last-spot and confined steps, then 29–40 ramp to 6×6/7×7 boards that need "would block" (about mid-Cozy). Kids boards are capped at 2×n steps.

Placed corgis are always correct, so they're locked: tapping one does nothing, and Undo only takes back paw marks (corgis and red paws stay).

## Field research reports

Settings → Field research mode asks for a 1–10 difficulty rating after each solve. Send report shares one CSV line per solved puzzle: `mode,id,size,lv,steps,secs,mistakes,hints,rating,date,chains,depth` (the last two are only filled for Extreme what-if boards). `lv` and `steps` come from the grader, so ratings vs `lv`/`steps` show how well the grader's difficulty matches how hard it felt.

## Releasing

Bump `VERSION` in `app.js` and `CACHE` in `sw.js` together. The version shows faintly at the bottom of the home screen; tap it to clear the cache and reload.

## Special dates

The 2026-11-11 week gets easy puzzles and a get-well banner. Every June 15 gets a birthday banner, an easy puzzle and a party hat for Cheddar. Messages live in `specialBanner()` and `winLine()` in `app.js`; the schedule lives in `want()` in `tools/generate.mjs`.
